# Error Generation For Grammatical Error Correction
This is an implementation of the error generation scheme introduced in the [https://aclanthology.org/W19-4415.pdf](paper): Erroneous data generation for Grammatical Error Correction. The existing word_trees json file can be replaced with another one to suit the original file from which the parallel files are created. You can do so by using [https://github.com/omarfawzyy/word_tree](this) repository  to construct a word tree for every word in your custom vocabulary and save it to a json file.
